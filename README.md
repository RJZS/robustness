# online-learning
This repository was created with the code used to simulate the adaptive observer from the upcoming paper by Burghi and Sepulchre. 
Collaborators are invited to experiment with the code and come up with ideas for applications.

The repository currently contains two HCO models:

HCO: The model was adapted from the paper "A positive feedback at the cellular level promotes robustness and modulation at the 
circuit level", By Dethier et al, 2015. 
The code simulates adaptive learning in two cases:
1 - "neuromodulation": the Calcium conductance is time-varying
2 - "mismatch": the internal dynamics is randomly perturbed

HCO: The model was adapted from the upcoming book by Drion, Franci and Sepulchre.
The code simulates adaptive learning in the perfect case where there is no model mismatch nor time-varying parameters.
