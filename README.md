# online-learning
This repository was created with the code used to simulate the adaptive observer from the upcoming paper by Burghi and Sepulchre. 
Collaborators are invited to experiment with the code and come up with ideas for applications.

The repository currently contains three models:

HH: The classic HH model, with modified internal dynamics as in Izhikevich 2007.

HCO: The model was adapted from the paper "A positive feedback at the cellular level promotes robustness and modulation at the 
circuit level", By Dethier et al, 2015. 
The code simulates adaptive learning during
"neuromodulation": the Calcium conductance is time-varying.

RB: The model was adapted from the same paper
as the HCO model. The code simulates adaptive
control of the rebound burster (RB).
